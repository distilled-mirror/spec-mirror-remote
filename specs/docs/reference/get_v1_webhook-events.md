# List Webhook Events

List all webhook events

## Authentication

This endpoint requires the following token type:

- **Client credentials access token** (`OAuth2ClientCredentials`) — obtained through the Client Credentials flow or the Refresh Token flow. See [Authentication for partners](https://developer.remote.com/docs/authentication-for-partners).

## Scopes

Any one of the scopes in a token type's row is enough. `all:read` and `all:write` work too.

| Token type | Category | Read only Scope | Write only Scope (read access implicit) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Client credentials access token | Manage company resources (`company_admin`) | View webhooks (`webhook:read`) | Manage webhooks (`webhook:write`) |
