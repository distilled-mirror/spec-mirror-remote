# Magic links generator

Generates a magic link for a passwordless authentication.
To create a magic link for a company admin, you need to provide the `user_id` parameter.
To create a magic link for an employee, you need to provide the `employment_id` parameter.

## Authentication

This endpoint accepts any one of the following token types:

- **Company-scoped access token** (`OAuth2AuthorizationCode`) — obtained by a company manager through the Authorization Code flow or the Refresh Token flow. See [Authentication for partners](https://developer.remote.com/docs/authentication-for-partners).
- **Company-scoped access token (assertion)** (`OAuth2CompanyManagerAssertion`) — obtained through the `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` grant for a company manager. See [OAuth Assertion](https://developer.remote.com/docs/authorization-method-oauth-assertion).

## Scopes

Any one of the scopes in a token type's row is enough. `all:write` works too.

| Token type | Category | Read only Scope | Write only Scope (read access implicit) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Company-scoped access token | Manage company resources (`company_admin`) | - | Create magic links (`magic_link:write`) |
| Company-scoped access token (assertion) | Manage company resources (`company_admin`) | - | Create magic links (`magic_link:write`) |
