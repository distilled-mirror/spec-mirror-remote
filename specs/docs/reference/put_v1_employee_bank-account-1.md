# Update employee bank account

Upserts the authenticated employee's bank account details.

This endpoint requires and returns country-specific data. The exact fields vary depending on which
country the authenticated employee's employment is in. Query the
[Show form schema](#tag/Countries/operation/get_show_form_country) endpoint with `bank_account_details`
as the form name to discover the schema for a given country.

## Authentication

This endpoint accepts any one of the following token types:

- **Employee-scoped access token** (`OAuth2Assertion`) — obtained through the `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` grant. See [OAuth Assertion](https://developer.remote.com/docs/authorization-method-oauth-assertion).
- **Company-scoped access token** (`OAuth2AuthorizationCode`) — obtained by the employee through the Authorization Code flow or the Refresh Token flow. See [Authentication for partners](https://developer.remote.com/docs/authentication-for-partners).

## Scopes

Any one of the scopes in a token type's row is enough. `all:write` works too.

| Token type | Category | Read only Scope | Write only Scope (read access implicit) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employee-scoped access token | Manage employments (`employments`) | - | Manage bank accounts (`bank_account:write`) |
| Company-scoped access token | Manage employments (`employments`) | - | - |

See [OAuth Assertion](https://developer.remote.com/docs/authorization-method-oauth-assertion).\n- **Company-scoped access token** (`OAuth2AuthorizationCode`) — obtained by the employee through the Authorization Code flow or the Refresh Token flow. See [Authentication for partners](https://developer.remote.com/docs/authentication-for-partners).\n\n## Scopes\n\nAny one of the scopes in a token type's row is enough. `all:write` works too.\n\n| Token type | Category | Read only Scope | Write only Scope (read access implicit) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Employee-scoped access token | Manage employments (`employments`) | - | Manage bank accounts (`bank_account:write`) |\n| Company-scoped access token | Manage employments (`employments`) | - | - |",
